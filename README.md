The goal is to determine the similarity between the charts of different musical resources

Solution stages:

1. Parsing charts of various music resources. Issue:
   - each site has its own layout

2. Identify tracks in the ratings, compile a general list of tracks. Issues:
   - the names of the performers could be in both Russian and English (Тимати, Timati)
   - there are cases with incorrect spelling of the artists' / tracks' titles

3. Calculate the similarity degree of charts between all possible pairs of resources. Issues:
   - it is necessary to determine the metric to calculate the similarity measure
   - resources have different number of tracks in charts

4. Visualize the result
